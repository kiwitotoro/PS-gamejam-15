## Brainstoming

Put all your ideas here. Add a ref if you implement it. 

NOTE: I want everyone to put their ideas under their name because they are your ideas. I think we can delete things here at the end as you might want to use your ideas yourself later.
If you have a really big idea, you can mention it, but maybe keep it to yourself if you dont want it stolen?
