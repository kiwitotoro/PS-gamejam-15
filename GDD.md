## Design History 

Current version: 0.0.1


## Section I - Game Overview

### Game Concept

Pirate software game jam No. 15 project

Theme: shadows and alcamy.

The design started with the discusion on how in Thors chat you should not feed the mods bread. We thought it would be funny if we tricked Thor into feeding the mods bread.

The idea is that the player is put under a darkness spell and cant see reality. you are told you need to make gold (using alcamy) but you are actually making bread.

Then you need to use the gold to pay the trolls to escape, but what you are actually doing is feeding the mods bread.


### Feature Set

### Genre

Top down action roguelike.


### Target Audience

Primary:
Thor
Secondary:
Thors goblins
Trinary:
Gammers

The main hope is that Thor will play it as part of the judging process. After that it is hoped that otherswill enjoy it but the main joke will be missed by any players who are not a part of Thors fandom.

### Game Flow Summary

You start in a wide open space as monsters move arround. you need to kill all the enemies needed to get all the ingredients on your list. one group will be more abundent and easy to beat but as you kill enemies, all enemies get more powerful and faster so you need to realize and only kill enough so you can beat the later hard enemies.

Then you make your way to a house and you can enter once you have all the ingredients.

in the house you defend your 'friend' who gave you the instructions as they do the alcamy to turn your ingrediants into gold (ingredients into bread) Then you give the gold to the trolls and as they start eating the gold the spell fades and thy become mods. The friend tells you you helped make a good loaf of bread and runs past the eating mods (leaving an open ended finish to the game).

Look and Feel 
Some ideas would be
vampire slayer
pixel art.


### Project Scope 

Number of locations: 3

First open area,
defend the kitchen scene.
Feeding the mods bread scene.

Number of levels:
Part one, open area, enemies get slowly harder so you can either have an easy smart fight, or a hard simple fight.

The kitchen fight will also get harder.



#### Number of NPC’s: 

Your guide / partner in crime.
The trolls blocking your escape (mods)

Forest area:
- skelitons
- lizard man
- 


Number of weapons: 

Start with a fire ball

then...?



## Brainstoming

Put all your ideas here. Add a ref if you implement it. 

NOTE: I want everyone to put their ideas under their name because they are your ideas. I think we can delete things here at the end as you might want to use your ideas yourself later.
If you have a really big idea, you can mention it, but maybe keep it to yourself if you dont want it stolen?


### Kiwi:
Bad music played as punishment :)
Use sound clips from stream?
    - Get permission?


### Rex:
Five goblins (us) in a trench coat?

## Section II - Gameplay and  Mechanics

### Gameplay

wasd movement and face towards the mouse.

### Game Progression

Start in field fighting monsters for ingredients.

In the kitchen fight is harder and more focused.

No fight after leaving the kitchen, just an end sequence (but player is still in control)

### Mission/challenge Structure

First area: fighing enemies to collect drops.
some drops appare later and if you kill to many enemies you will have a harder fight against them

Second area: need to stop waves of enemies.

(boss fight?)

### Puzzle Structure

No puzzles?

If we add a puzzle, we could have something where we help the cook in the kitchen? move items to different areas, make sure things dont burn etc?

### Objectives

What are the objectives of the game?

Collect items to make gold.

Defend NPC as they make gold.

Give gold to trolls to escape.

### Play Flow 

Collect ingredients ASAP avoid over killing easy enemies to keep the end game easy.

Once you have all you need, escape to the house.

The kitchen fight will be in waves to give the player down time (puzzle aspects could go in the downtime if we add them?)

### Mechanics

Move around a 2D plain with enemies spawning around. shoot towards the mouse position.
What are the rules to the game, both implicit and explicit.  This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact?  This actually can be a very large section.


### Physics 

Not sure what to say here? We could add slides or jumps... tweaking the movements to make playing satisfying...

### How does the physical universe work?


### Movement

wasd and space to jump (not needed)?

interact with NPCs if you click nar them

(if you try to attack your friend...) -> You cant shoot? or he takes no damage? and makes a comment like "hey, who wil make the gold..?

In the kitchen scene, maybe hav some things like turrets to give you better firepower for a little while?


### General Movement

### Other Movement



### Objects

Part one enemies drop ingredients.

### Picking Up Objects

Walk over them? maybe magnatize and pull them to the character within a range?

Keep items on the floor forever? or fade after x seconds? (play testing?)

### Moving Objects

NA?

### Actions

not used?

### Switches and Buttons

NA?

### Picking Up, Carrying and Dropping

NA?

### Talking

Attack non enemy to talk?

### Reading

If there is a speech block on screen, the game is paused.

>>> Maybe there could be non required speech which pops up above character.

### Combat

part one like vampire survivor.

part two the same, but a smaller space and you need to defend an area (you cant just run away)


### Economy

What is the economy of the game? How does it work?

trolls like gold?

### Screen Flow

Big area
  |
  |
The house
  |
  |
The troll barrier


### Screen Flow Chart

A graphical description of how each screen is related to every other


### Screen Descriptions

What is the purpose of each screen? 


#### Main Menu Screen

 Start game
 Load save game (if we implement it)
 Gdd (link to the game design document) -- limited info at first. offer a full version link after the player finishes the game?
 

#### Options Screen

* customize controls?
* ..?
* 


#### Game Options

ToDo

### Replaying and Saving 

Do we want the game to work for speed runners?

### Cheats and Easter Eggs

Hide the GDD ingame and only give access after they win (to avoid spolers?) - This might need to be turned off for the judges.

Maybe we could put easter eggs in the forest where the monsters spawn?

## Section III – Story, Setting and Character  

You are the player, a goblin
You wake up with another goblin who tells you the situation. You are under attack and need to escape. but trolls are blocking your escape. BUT, trolls love gold, andyour friend has a recipie to make gold so if you fight off the monsters and collect ingredients for the alcamy your friend will do the majic to make the gold. Then you can escape together.

You beat all the monsters to collect the ingredients.

While making the gold, you need to defend your friend from the monsters.

After you get the gold you take it to the trolls.

As they eat the majic wears off you and you can see reality.

Your friend was a troll.
The trolls are the mods.
The gold was actually bread.
The mods, eating bread, let your friend (the troll) through to the internet... they are an internet troll!!!!
What will happen now?  The end.

#### Synopsis

Start here, kill monsters to collect ingredients for the gold creation spell.


Introductory Material

You wake up in the clearing. Another goblin is with you.
Other goblin: Are you OK? They really got you good, those scarry monsters! Don't worry. We goblins need to stick together. It's not safe for us here any longer... We need to escape but there are big trolls blocking the path. The monsters will keep coming, so we need to give the trolls gold to let us pass. Take this (Scroll appares on screen). We need to collect all the ingredients before they get to strong. when you have everything we need bring it here to the house. I will do the spells to turn the ingredients into gold, then We can give it to the trolls to get past and escape!

#### Objectives

Collect the following:


0/20 Stagnant water (green liquid - yellow smoke?) {warm water}
0/5 Soggy toes from nomes (mushrooms are fine) {Active dry yeast}
0/5 Crushed petrified gargoyles (small pile of yellow crystals?) {granulted sugar or honey}
0/3 shattered glass bats remains (small pile of white crystals) {Salt}
0/10 Sap from mucus tree (brown liquid - with green smoke) {oil}
0/30 bone meal from skeiton (large pile of white powder) {flour}

(with the above numbers you need to kill atleast 70 enimies).

every kill the level goes up.
If you kill 30, the level goes up a lot.
then again at 60
at 90 the enemies should be VERY hard.

So enemy strength (at the moment of spawn could be: elapsed time in seconds * number of enemies killed
Add bonus 30 points at 30, 60, 90, 120 kills
add 30 points at 3 min, and 5 minutes.

also increase how far enimies can see and their speed over time.

If you die and the game sees ou killed too many skelitons get a message:

"Maybe only kill as many as you need?"

If you die and you had all the ingredients:

"Once you have what you need, get out of the forent ASAP! exit is below the forest at the farm house.

## Section VI - Artificial Intelligence

### Opponent AI

Slimes drop: Stagnant water
slow but very strong (lots of hits to kill) after a whoile they heal (this gets faster over time)

gargoyles drop: Crushed petrified gargoyles
Dont move, randomly teleport around the play field. attack in 3 directions, vunrible in the fourth?

bats drop: shattered glass bats remains
small and fast. take swooping dives at player, need to time block to stunn them?

Poison mucus trees drop: Sap from mucus tree
Trees spawn randomly and grow fast 2-3 second animation? Looks like a venus fly trap. tries to eat player.

Skelitons drop: bone meal from skeiton
free roaming (straight line?) if player comes in range they will attack and chase, will loose interest after player leaves field of view.
As time goes on field grows, time of pesuite increases...

The active opponent that plays against the game player and therefore requires strategic decision making (example, Civilization or Chess, how is it to be designed?
