# Shadows and Alchemy

## Shadows

a dark area or shape produced by a body coming between rays of light and a surface.
"trees cast long shadows"
used in reference to a position of relative inferiority or obscurity.
"he lived in the shadow of his father"
a person secretly following and observing another.
"no matter where Johnson went, his shadow stayed with him"

### ideas:

stealth games (ninja) hide in the shadows.

stalker game: you need to follow or 'shadow' another character like you wach them go through the level, then you need to do it the same way.







## Alchemy

noun
the medieval forerunner of chemistry, concerned with the transmutation of matter, in particular with attempts to convert base metals into gold or find a universal elixir.
"occult sciences, such as alchemy and astrology"

note: key goal was gold...

### ideas:

have a crafting michanic. split gold into 10 units each of mana, health and skills
22 units of each turn into the same gold. you get more points for more gold, but you need to use gold to win.

enemies are alcanists and turning inocent forest animals into gold... you need to stop them?

use items to make better items. they blow up if you fail, the process is a time sensitive puzzle?

### mix the Ideas:

ninjas vs alcamists!

do alcamy on shadows? different chemicals make them react differently. make your shadow into a weapon to cut the enemy, make it a light to illimanate other shadows... turn to gold (bad? locks player in place?) make the shadow butter slide around the level...
