# Shadows and Alchemy

## Shadows

a dark area or shape produced by a body coming between rays of light and a surface.
"trees cast long shadows"
used in reference to a position of relative inferiority or obscurity.
"he lived in the shadow of his father"
a person secretly following and observing another.
"no matter where Johnson went, his shadow stayed with him"

### ideas:

stealth games (ninja) hide in the shadows.

stalker game: you need to follow or 'shadow' another character like you wach them go through the level, then you need to do it the same way.







## Alchemy

noun
the medieval forerunner of chemistry, concerned with the transmutation of matter, in particular with attempts to convert base metals into gold or find a universal elixir.
"occult sciences, such as alchemy and astrology"

note: key goal was gold...

### ideas:

have a crafting michanic. split gold into 10 units each of mana, health and skills
22 units of each turn into the same gold. you get more points for more gold, but you need to use gold to win.

enemies are alcanists and turning inocent forest animals into gold... you need to stop them?

use items to make better items. they blow up if you fail, the process is a time sensitive puzzle?

### mix the Ideas:

ninjas vs alcamists!

do alcamy on shadows? different chemicals make them react differently. make your shadow into a weapon to cut the enemy, make it a light to illimanate other shadows... turn to gold (bad? locks player in place?) make the shadow butter slide around the level...


## story

you wake up and a 'shadowy' figure tells you you must use alcemy to make gold to brib the trolls for both of your freedom.

you start in a forest with a recipie for gold:
bonemeal * 5
poisonus fungus from a lizardmans foot. *1
monster mucus *2
ground up rocks of petrified faries
toxic water from the putrid ponds.

you collect all this from killing monsters.


then your partner will cast the spells while you defend them (boss fight)
the boss runs away screaming gibberish.

you take the gold to the trolls and they start eating it...
then your partner joins you laughing. they remove the spell and show that they were an (internet) troll the trolls wer the mods and the gold was bread: bonemeal = flour, poisonus fungus = yeast... monster mucus = oil petrified fairy rocks = salt toxic water = fresh lake water.

you scream Noooooo!!!!

the reason I think this would be cool is because Thor will feed the mods the bread without knowing it...
